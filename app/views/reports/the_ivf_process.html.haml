 .faqquestion Fertilization and ICSI
 .faqanswer.hidden
  %p Sperm and egg are incubated together for nearly 24 hours until two pronuclei are observed, indicating fertilization. In the case of low sperm count, a single sperm may be injected into the egg via intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI).

 .faqquestion Growth in the Laboratory
 .faqanswer.hidden
  %p Typically, embryos are transferred 3 days after retrieval, once they have reached the 6-8 cell stage. However, in some cases, embryos are not transferred until 5 days after retrieval in what is called a blastocyst stage transfer. Some IVF clinics prefer to transfer embryos at the blastocyst stage.

 .faqquestion Embryo Transfer
 .faqanswer.hidden
  %p After the embryologist grades the embryos, the highest quality embryos are transferred to the patient√≠s uterus. Often more than one embryo is transferred to improve the odds of pregnancy. This does not improve the chance of implantation of each embryo individually.

 .faqquestion Cryopreservation and Vitrification
 .faqanswer.hidden
  %p Extra embryos that grow apparently normally but are not transferred may be frozen or vitrified, Both methods are very similar since they both use anti-freeze to protect the cells during cooling, but while during regular freezing the medium surrounding the embryo changes into ice, during vitrification the fluid changes into a glass-like substance. It is still unclear whether vitrification is better than freezing, but it is likely that this will be determined soon.
