<h1>Our Ranking System</h1>
<p>At IVF Reports, we base our rankings on two core values: safety and quality. We believe that these are the most important aspects a patient should consider when looking for a clinic. To quantify these values, we have gathered publicly available statistics from the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology, and we have made use of two key measurements: the average number of embryos transferred per cycle, and the average implantation rate per embryo.</p>
<h2>Our Safety Score</h2>
<p>The average number of embryos transferred is the statistic we employ to measure safety. Multiple-birth pregnancies put both the mother and the children at higher risk than a single-birth pregnancy. Thus, our guiding principal is that, all else being equal, clinics that transfer fewer embryos on average maintain higher standards of safety in their practice.</p>
<h2>Our Quality Score</h2>
<p>While it has become common practice to evaluate IVF Clinics based on their live birth rate per cycle, this statistic may be misleading. Live birth rate can be artificially inflated by transferring more embryos than what is considered safe, potentially jeopardizing the health of the patient and the typical outcome of a pregnancy. For example, if a clinician transfers five embryos back to a woman resulting in two live births, this cycle will count as a 100% live birth rate per cycle. However, this is accomplished at considerable risk to the mother. Many factors contribute to the success of a pregnancy, and using live birth rate as a statistic may obscure the true performance of a clinic with respect to success in IVF.</p>
<p>To assess quality, our ranking system derives a score based on the implantation rate. The implantation rate is the frequency of implantation (when an embryo attaches to the uterus and forms a sac or fetus) related to the number of embryos transferred per patient. In our previous example, the clinician who transferred five embryos and achieved a live birth rate of 100% actually had an implantation rate of 40%. By judging success per embryo, the clinician cannot inflate his performance rating by transferring more embryos.</p>
<h2>Scoring Across Age Groups</h2>
<p>IVF outcomes vary significantly with the age of the eggs of each woman. Overall, we evaluate information according to maternal age and national outcome results. While evaluations are made separately for each age group, IVF reports also determines a combined score according to how well a clinic performed across all age groups. The use of this information allows for the evaluation of clinics based on the quality of their embryo transfers, and it prevents artificial inflation of results by simply transferring more embryos or avoiding to treat patients in older age groups.</p>
<h2>Scoring Across Multiple Years of Data: The Consistency Score</h2>
<p>IVF Clinics may experience individual year-to-year variation in their outcomes. One year might yield particularly good implantation rates, and the next year might not be so high. To take into account variation in yearly performances, IVF Reports uses data from the immediately preceding available year, in conjunction with data from the most recent year, to derive a consistency score for each clinic.</p>
<p>The consistency score is also weighted according to the proportion of cycles done in the previous year. A consistency score can count up to as much as 50% of the final score in our system. However, for a clinic that performed lower volume in the previous year, the consistency score will only account for a percentage of the score proportional to the number of cycles performed in the previous year.</p>
<h2>The SART Score</h2>
<p>Although the core principals behind IVF Reports dictate that implantation rate is a much more informative measure of success, we still provide a score that assesses clinics based on the live birth rate. Data concerning the live birth rate are available at the SART webpage, and SART emphasizes these data as an important factor in assessing IVF success among clinics. The SART score is provided for comparison purposes only, and it does not factor into the IVF Reports score in any way.</p>
