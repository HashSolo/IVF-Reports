<h1>Clinicians</h1>
<p>If you are an owner or employee of a U.S. Fertility Clinic, we encourage you to contact the IVF Reports team to get set up with a Clinic Account on our site. A Clinic Account provides you with the ability to take control of your profile on our website. Moreover, we provide a forum by which you can meet more patients and help bring more life into this world.</p> 
<p><img src="<%= asset_path 'clinic_statistics.png' %>" width="240" class="clinicians_page"/>Finally, with the help of computer scientists and statisticians, we have built an advanced clinic analytics tool that will allow you to easily view, analyze and understand how your clinic has performed, in various settings, relative to the nation. We provide this tool free of charge because our ultimate goal is to facility a better understanding of the science behind fertility. We want to help you give the gift of life to more families.</p>
<p>To learn more or set up a clinic account, please contact an IVF Reports representative at <b>info [at] ivfreports [dot] org</b> or call 646-470-7422. We hope to work with you in the future.
